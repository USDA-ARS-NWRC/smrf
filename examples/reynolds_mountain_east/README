		     * DEM was downloaded from ASTER Global DEM via https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
		     * topo.nc was generated using basin_setup -f raw_data/rme_basin_outline.shp -dm ~/Downloads/ASTGTM2_N43W117/ASTGTM2_N43W117_dem.tif --cell_size 50
		     * Station data was generate from a publish data set using the script ./setup_scripts/convert_rem.py to put data in SMRF compatible format
